# GNU Octave adaptation of fcollman's abfload()
I forked the abfload() function from fcollman/abfload github repository (https://github.com/fcollman/abfload), to provide a working function for GNU Octave. There are small differences in function calls between Matlab and GNU Octave that does not make the original fcollman's function work straight in GNU Octave.

Please see https://github.com/fcollman/abfload for any issues under Matlab.

The main changes concerning GNU Octave vs Matlab compatibility are found by searching the comments: % tt 202203 ...
